This is my take on a recipie website from The Odin Project's curriculum. It will be mostly made using HTML at first but i will revisit it later to add to it using CSS. 

I will be making a homepage which will link to different recipies, i will show the recipies using images. The recipies will be explained uising lists and other basic HTML elements.
